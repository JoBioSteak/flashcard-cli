#Flashcard CLI

This is a simple flashcard app utilizing the command line for active recall - using biochemistry questions from a csv file

Features:
1) Loads questions from a .csv file
2) Randomises the order
3) Keeps track of the user's score with each card
4) Easy to extend with more flashcards or AI-capabilities

CSV Format
The flashcards will be loaded from the csv file like this:
question,answer,score(1-easy,2-medium,3-difficult)
e.g
What sugar is found in DNA?,Deoxyribose,1

Motivation
This is my first project of many. It is my first step into learning Git,Python and eventually, AI. It will start of basic, using only simple code but will soon evolve into something more abitious overtime.

Coming Soon
Adaptive Testing - instead of the questions being chosen at random, they will be selected based on the user's skill using the score
More subject categories and filtering
AI-generated questions
