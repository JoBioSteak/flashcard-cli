# 🧠 Flashcard CLI

This is a simple flashcard app utilizing the command line for **active recall** — using biochemistry questions from a CSV file.

Features:  
1) 📂 Loads questions from a `.csv` file 
2) 🎲 Randomises the order  
3) 📊 Keeps track of the user's score with each card  


CSV Format  
The flashcards will be loaded from the CSV file like this:  
`question,answer,score (1-easy, 2-medium, 3-difficult)`  
e.g.  
`What sugar is found in DNA?,Deoxyribose,1`

Motivation  
This is my first project of many. It is my first step into learning **Git**, **Python**, and eventually, **AI**. It will start off basic — using only simple code — but will soon evolve into something more ambitious over time. 🧬💻

Coming Soon  
- 🔁 Adaptive Testing - instead of the questions being chosen at random, they will be selected based on the user's skill using the score  
- 🧠 More subject categories and filtering  
- 🤖 AI-generated questions
